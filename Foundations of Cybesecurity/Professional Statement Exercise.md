> I am excited and passionate about combining my software engineering skills with my newfound cybersecurity knowledge/skills to provide the utmost security for enterprise applications. I am also passionate about using the many different tools to accomplish security goals.

2. **What would I like for my future coworkers to know about me?**

> I am a team player, I find company and team culture to be very important. I enjoy bouncing ideas off people, collaborating, and being mission focused. I think having both strong technical, verbal communication skills, and a team mindset leads to the best and most efficient results.

3. **Who is the audience for my professional statement (e.g., cybersecurity recruiters, Software engineer recruiters, specific organizations, government employers, etc.)?**

> I'd say anywhere from small start ups to large organizations. I think as long as the work is fulfilling I am open to many companies.

4. **How do you feel your experience differs from your peers?**

> I think what separates me in regards to my experience is that it is multifaceted. I have worked as a software engineer for several years in different sectors such as government, ed-tech, and cybersecurity. I think combining my knowledge and experience as a software engineer with my newfound cybersecurity skills/knowledge, I would be a well rounded security professional understanding both software creation and software security.

5. **What do I have to offer potential employers that is unique**?

> I offer to employers several things I deem to be important as an engineer and security professional. The first being software/coding expertise, having worked on several enterprise applications from the ground up and understanding application and code architecture. In light of the first, the second is understanding the security of the application and what needs to be implemented for the application to be as secure as possible. The last is being malleable, in this field and in particular the roles of engineers and security professionals, you should always be open to learning and trying new things as well as being able to tailor your expertise to a company's needs.

## Use this time to self-reflect and analyze why you want to pursue a career in cybersecurity.

1. **What interests you the most about a career in cybersecurity?**

2. **What do you want to learn more about in the field of cybersecurity?**

> I'd like to learn more about the different technologies that are used to block and/or stop application attacks.

3. **What do you hope to achieve as a cybersecurity professional (e.g., analyst, security engineer, appsec engineer)?**

> What I hope to achieve is the role of an application/security architect.

### Select two of your strengths. These can be strengths you currently have or ones that you are learning about and plan to develop throughout the program (e.g., collaboration, problem-solving, communication, using SIEM and other tools to identify and mitigate threats, risks, vulnerabilities, etc.)

> Incident response

> Risk management with SIEM and other tools

3. **Select two of your values. Examples might include upholding an individual's right to privacy and a commitment to helping organizations ensure confidential data is safe.**

> Protecting users from data and privacy breaches
> Providing privacy for users

4. **Create a core statement that represents your purpose or intention. In this case, your purpose or intention is to briefly explain or summarize your strengths and values in one to two sentences.**

> As a seasoned software engineer transitioning into cybersecurity, I leverage my expertise in secure software development and full-stack web applications to identify and mitigate risks, fostering a “security by design” approach throughout the development lifecycle. My goal is to bridge the gap between development and security teams, ensuring the protection of sensitive information through application security and vulnerability assessment.

5. **Explain how your chosen strengths and values help you accomplish your core statement.**

> By valuing collaboration and a deep understanding of both development and cybersecurity, I can effectively bridge the gap between teams to safeguard systems against evolving cyber threats.
