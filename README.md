# Google Cybersecurity Certificate Program

Google Cybersecurity Certificate Program for Raymond Nwambuonwo

This repo holds all of the projects I have done so far while completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Program.

In this course I am gaining foundational knowledge that will build upon my software engineering experience and expertise to then transition into security focused roles.

This program focused on many conceptual topics such as:

- Risk management
- Threat analysis
- Network security
- Incident response

It also enhanced my technical knowledge and skills in regards to the following:

- Linux
- Python
- SQL
- SIEM tools (Splunk and Chronicle)
- Network protocol analyzers (Wireshark and tcpdump)
- IDS/IPS tools
- Firewalls

Please take the time to go through this repository as it serves as the beginning of my pivot from software engineering into cybersecurity. The following directory contains the files for each of the courses in the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Program as well as the order they were completed in is:

1. Foundations of Cybersecurity
2. Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
3. Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security
