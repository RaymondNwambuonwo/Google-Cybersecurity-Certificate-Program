# Data Leak Assessment

## This lab consists of reviewing the results of a data risk assessment. You will determine whether effective data handling processes are being implemented to protect information privacy

### Scenario

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students. Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided. A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.
